### Hi there 😺

I'm Natalia Baez — a physicist with a deep curiosity for how physical principles can inspire intelligent systems. My academic background in atomic and quantum physics has taught me to approach complex problems with rigor, creativity, and pattern recognition — skills that I now channel into the fields of data science, artificial intelligence, and software development.

🌌 **My Journey So Far**  
- 🧠 Thesis in atomic physics: _"Atom-Field Interaction in Dispersive Optical Lattices"_  
- 💻 Professional experience as a **full-stack web developer** in public health institutions
- 📊 Specialized training in data science, Python, and machine learning through hands-on courses and personal projects  
- 📚 Teaching assistant in computing for physicists 

🔬 **What Drives Me**  
I’m passionate about connecting scientific reasoning with real-world applications. My mission is to contribute to innovative, interdisciplinary projects — especially those that explore the intersection of physics, AI, and human understanding.

🧰 **Tech Stack & Tools**  
- Languages: Python, JavaScript, Julia  
- Frameworks: Angular, Django  
- Tools: Git, SQL, Notion, Streamlit, LaTeX, Adobe Illustrator  
- Areas of interest: Quantum AI, Physics-Informed Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Cognitive & Complex Systems

🌍 **Languages**  
- Spanish (native)  
- English (B2)

📌 I’m currently deepening my knowledge in machine learning (theory & hands-on)
